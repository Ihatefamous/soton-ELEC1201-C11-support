The project aim to give support to those who are getting stuck in Southampton ELEC1201-C11 lab. The project is based on Il Matto Board and there is outcome of the project in the video.  
  
The project aims for improving learning outcome from the lab, but not coping the code dirctly. It is always great if you could pick up the main idea of the program and create a better one or at least learn from it and write your own one.
